Worst Case for Sorting algorithms:

Heap sort: O(n)
Insertion Sort: O(n^2)
Bubble Sort: O(n^2)
Selection Sort: O(n^2)
Comb Sort: O(n^2)
Cocktail Sort: O(n^2)

Most of these implementations have their worst case when the list is 
completly backwards in its order. So the sorting method has to go 
through all the elements, moving them accordingly.
